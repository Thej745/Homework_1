# "**Motor Car trends**"

The **`mtcars`** dataset, included in base R, contains data on 32 car models from the 1970s. Each row represents a car, with variables such as horsepower, weight, and miles-per-gallon (MPG). 

In this brief analysis, we explore the relationship between a car's **horsepower** and its **fuel efficiency** measured in MPG.
